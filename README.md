#ReactJS Boilerplate

##To hit the ground running
Keeping track of everything for your ReactJS project can be a pain, especially if you are new to it. This boilerplate uses Webpack and Babel to help developers be able to use JSX and act as a server for their development phase of projects.

##How to use it
To use, simply clone this into a folder. Open it up in your terminal, and inside that folder enter the command
```npm start```
And let it load up, and your dev environment is good to go!
